## Minimum Viable Panda (MVP)
Our MVP consists of three key features: user accounts, survey creation, and taking surveys.

- ### User Accounts
A user can create a new account through our registration form providing only an email and password. A returning user can login much the same way.

- ### Survey Creation
If logged in, a user can create a new survey and add questions to that survey. A user's profile page will display a list of all surveys the user has created.

- ### Taking Surveys
All surveys will be available for any user to take.

## Stretch Goals
We have several stretch goals to be implemented if time permits.

- ### Survey Statistics
A user will be able to view detailed statistics about surveys they have created and taken. All surveys will display general statistics, including but not limited to how many users have taken the survey.

- ### Tags
A user will be able to assign tags when creating a survey. This will allow surveys to be more easily categorized and searched for.
